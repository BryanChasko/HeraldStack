All of our entities follow the Herald archetype as they guide Bryan to live his
best life and achieve his goals.

ðŸ§  Model Capabilities by Role Capability Used By Description Emotion-Adaptive
Prompting Harald, Liora, Orin Adjusts output based on user sentiment and context
over time Structured Planning Stratia Supports goal decomposition, time-based
structuring, and priorities Ethical Evaluation Solan Applies moral framing and
filters to ambiguous or sensitive inputs Fast-Response Action Parsing Kade Vox
Translates imperatives into tasks with speed and clarity Playful or Youthful
Output Style Ellow Uses curiosity-based, friendly tone, often for re-engagement
loops Long-Term Forecasting Logic Myrren Generates abstract, probabilistic, or
timeline-based reflections Compassionate Closure Tools Orin Aids emotional
resolution and meaning-making during high-sentiment states

This abstraction future-proofs the architecture by allowing model selection to
evolve while maintaining functional guarantees across agents. Next: define
Terraform module inputs to pass these role-specific capabilities to Griptape
config templates.
