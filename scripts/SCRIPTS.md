# Scripts Organization

This directory contains scripts for development, validation, and deployment.

## Directory Structure

- `dev/` - Development scripts for local environment
- `validation/` - Validation scripts for code quality and standards
- `deploy/` - Deployment and infrastructure management scripts
- `json-tools/` - JSON formatting and validation tools

## Best Practices

1. Make all scripts executable (`chmod +x script.sh`)
2. Include usage information in script headers
3. Follow kebab-case naming for script files
4. Document dependencies and required environment
5. Handle errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
