Historical migration documentation from the 2025 shell-to-Rust transition has

directory. These documents provide context for past migration decisions but are
no longer part of active development workflows.

For current development guidelines, see:

- [docs/DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md](../DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md)
