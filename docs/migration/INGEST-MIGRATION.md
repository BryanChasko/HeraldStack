# Ingest Module Migration

This document records the migration of the Rust ingest code from `rust_ingest/` to
`src/ingest/`.

## Migration Steps Completed

1. Created `src/ingest/` directory
2. Copied Rust files from `rust_ingest/src/*.rs` to `src/ingest/`
3. Updated package name from `rust_ingest` to `harald_ingest`
4. Created new Cargo.toml in the `src` directory
5. Updated imports in main.rs to use new package name
6. Fixed E0433 errors related to unresolved module references
7. Created README.md with documentation
8. Created build script at `scripts/dev/build-ingest.sh`
9. Updated path references in the code
10. Successfully built the migrated code

## Next Steps

1. Run tests on the migrated code:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev/build-ingest.sh --test
   ```

2. Update any scripts that referenced the old `rust_ingest` directory

3. After successful validation, deprecated the old `rust_ingest/` directory:

   ```bash
   # After verification that everything works
   mv rust_ingest rust_ingest.old
   ```

## Benefits of New Structure

1. All source code is now in the `src` directory, following standard conventions
2. The code is organized by domain rather than technology
3. Module boundaries are clearer in the new structure
4. Future functionality can be added to the `src` directory with consistent organization
