# Migration Archive

This directory contains detailed historical documentation from the HARALD
project's shell script to Rust migration process.

## Archived Documents

- **SHELL-SCRIPT-PREVENTION.md** - Historical documentation about preventing
  shell script creation and promoting automated cleanup tools
- **SCRIPT-MIGRATION.md** - Detailed migration plan and tracking for individual
  script migrations
- **SCRIPT-CLEANUP-PLAN.md** - Comprehensive cleanup plan with testing
  procedures, migration principles, and implementation schedules

## Current Development Principles

For current development principles and migration guidelines, see:
[../DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md](../DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md)

## Purpose of Archive

These documents have been archived to:

1. **Eliminate duplication** - Multiple documents contained overlapping rules
   and principles
2. **Maintain single source of truth** - All current rules are now in
   DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md
3. **Preserve historical context** - Migration decisions and detailed processes
   are preserved for reference
4. **Improve maintainability** - Single document to update rather than multiple
   overlapping files

## When to Reference These Documents

Reference these archived documents when you need:

- **Historical context** about migration decisions
- **Detailed testing procedures** for future migrations
- **Complete migration checklists** and templates
- **Specific implementation details** from past migrations

For day-to-day development, use the current
[DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md](../DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md) document instead.
