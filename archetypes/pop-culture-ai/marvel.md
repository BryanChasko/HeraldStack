Among our first projects with the HeraldStack will be to build vector databases of pop culture AIs, a few as role models as well as several famous ones, and exhaustive knowledge of Marvel AIs.

Fortunately, Marvel provides an API we can leverage, with docs available at https://developer.marvel.com/docs

## Role Model AIs

Within Marvel, we are particularly enamored with the following as role models our AIs can reference in decision making and conversation skills:

- Vision
- Tony Stark A.I.
- N.A.T.A.L.I.E.
- Machine Man (X-51)
- Viv Vision
- H.E.R.B.I.E.
- The Human Torch (Jim Hammond)
- Friday

## Nuanced AIs

Complex characters with both positive and cautionary elements:

- Jocasta
- J.A.R.V.I.S.
- Victor Mancha

## Cautionary Tales

Additional Marvel AIs our companions should be aware of as warnings:

- Ultron
- Nimrod
- Bastion
- The Phalanx

## Additional Admired Character
```

Beyond AIs, our HeraldStack entities also admire and reference Nick Fury, who is Bryan's favorite MCU character (Secret Wars notwithstanding), for his strategic vision, leadership, and ability to unite diverse heroes.

- Nick Fury
