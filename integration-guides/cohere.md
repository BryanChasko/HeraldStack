Cohere Best Practices for HeraldStack v0.0.1
📄 Document ID: BP-COHERE-v0.0.1
📅 Version Date: 2025-07-04
🔧 Maintainer: HeraldStack Core Team

🔍 Purpose
This document outlines integration and operational best practices for using Cohere in the HeraldStack ambient intelligence system. Cohere is chosen for its:

✅ Lightweight multilingual embeddings (e.g., embed-multilingual-v3.0)

✅ Optimized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support

✅ Fast API response times suitable for real-time interaction

✅ Flexible hosting options (Cohere-hosted or self-managed inference)

Use Cohere to complement other LLM providers like OpenAI or Anthropic in cases where cost-efficiency, multilingual support, or speed are critical.

⚙️ Core Integration Principles
Component	Integration Pattern	Notes
Embeddings	Use embed-multilingual-v3.0 (or embed-english-light-v3.0) for fast vector generation	Excellent for Pinecone or FAISS pipelines
RAG	Combine embed + generate with system prompts for lightweight QA	Keep context windows small to leverage speed
Routing	Route multilingual or fallback requests to Cohere using Griptape or LangChain routing logic	Define agent preferences via metadata

🧠 Model Selection
Use Case	Recommended Model	Notes
Fast document search	embed-english-light-v3.0	Lowest latency
Multilingual knowledge retrieval	embed-multilingual-v3.0	100+ language support
Summary + QA	command-r-plus or command-r	Optimized for RAG
Structured tasks	command-r-plus + function calling	Beta support; combine with Lambda/Bedrock fallback

🧩 Deployment Notes
Use batch embedding where possible for cost savings.

Leverage token-based filters (e.g., doc_type, persona) in Pinecone metadata to streamline recall.

Ensure stateless retry logic for 429 throttling errors (adaptive exponential backoff).

Set up cost observability—Cohere offers per-token billing via API key usage reports.

📦 Fast Vector Pipeline Example (LangChain)
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
from langchain.embeddings import CohereEmbeddings

embeddings = CohereEmbeddings(cohere_api_key="...", model="embed-multilingual-v3.0")
vectorstore = Pinecone.from_texts(
    texts=document_chunks,
    embedding=embeddings,
    index_name="heraldstack-index"
)
🛡️ Security & Governance
Rotate API keys every 30–90 days.

Isolate API keys per agent (e.g., Herald, Athena) for audit trails.

Use env-scoped secrets with Lambda or Dockerized pipelines.

Do not store raw user data in prompts or vectors—use UUID references + metadata only.

📈 Observability
Enable latency and token logging via Cohere's dashboard.

Emit internal logs for:

embedding_latency_ms

generation_token_usage

prompt_lang_detected

Set alerts for:

RAG misses (no results found)

Prompt injection or hallucination patterns

🚀 Scaling Guidance
Phase	Tips
Dev	Use command-r and dev keys; limit context size
Pilot	Tune index size and metadata filters; introduce multilingual QA tests
Prod	Regionalize vector indices (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1); optimize with cost-aware routing

🔄 Interoperability
Combine with OpenAI for generation and Cohere for embedding in multilingual flows.

Can be paired with Haystack pipelines or Griptape Memory Tool.

For offline scenarios, pre-compute Cohere embeddings and store locally (e.g., SQLite + FAISS).

🧠 Summary
Use Cohere when:

Multilingual document support is needed

Real-time latency is a constraint

Embedding cost efficiency is a priority

You need fallback lightweight RAG that scales independently of OpenAI/Anthropic dependencies
