# Microsoft GenAI – Secure, Scalable Architecture

## 1. GenAI Gateway via Azure API Management (APIM)

- **Centralized Gateway**: Deploy APIM as a unified GenAI gateway to manage
  Azure OpenAI (AOAI) and on-premises/custom LLM endpoints.
  - Enables unified rate limiting (TPM/token tracking), authentication,
    observability, and billing.

- **Latency Optimization**: Use self-hosted APIM gateways near private LLM
  instances to minimize cloud routing latency.

## 2. Secure GenAI Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: Enforce principle of least privilege on permissions to
  prevent API misuse or unauthorized data access.

- **Zero-Trust**: Apply Zero-Trust principles across network, data, access,
  application, and governance controls.

- **MonitOring & Logging**: Integrate Azure Monitor, Sentinel, and Azure AI
  Evaluations SDK in CI/CD for GenAIOps, feedback loops, and A/B testing.

## 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Interoperable Agent Framework

### 3.1 What is MCP

- Open-standard, JSON-RPC 2.0–based protocol from Anthropic, adopted by OpenAI,
  Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and others for tool-aware LLMs.
  - References: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org),
    [techcommunity.microsoft.com](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com)
- Enables LLMs to connect to filesystems, APIs, databases, browser automation,
  and more.

### 3.2 Key Benefits

- **Seamless Microsoft Tool Access**: Simplifies context/tool access for agents
  (e.g., Copilot).
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Enables cross-vendor interoperability and
  orchestration.
- **Tool Marketplaces**: Opens up tool marketplaces (Copilot Studio tool
  listing, Dataverse integration).

### 3.3 Secure & Enterprise-ready MCP

- Leverage MCP Guardian or MCP Gateway architectures for hardened deployments
  (WAF, tool authentication, rate limiting, logging).

## 4. Integrating HeraldStack with MCP + GenAI

| Layer          | Recommendations                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent Core     | Integrate Herald agents as MCP clients—connect via Azure MCP Server or self-hosted MCP Gateway.                                    |
| Tools/Data     | Expose internal APIs, DBs, search via MCP server connectors; support grounding via Bing, Azure Search.                             |
| Gateway        | Front Herald traffic through APIM gateway to manage AOAI/OpenAI endpoints alongside on-prem LLMs, applying security and telemetry. |
| CI/CD + Ops    | Automate agent and prompt deployment; pipeline-run AI evaluations, feedback loop, security scans.                                  |
| Security       | Embed Zero-Trust, strict permissions, encryption in transit, MCP Guardian for defense.                                             |
| Tool Ecosystem | Register Herald MCP Server in Copilot/Teams AI tool listings for internal adoption; support multi-agent workflows.                 |

## 5. Next Steps

- **Prototype**: Deploy Azure APIM as GenAI gateway; integrate AOAI and sample
  on-prem LLM.
- **MCP Server**: Build Herald MCP Server (using open-source SDKs in
  Python/TypeScript/C#), register internal services, and test agent workflows.
- **Security Hardening**: Add MCP Guardian layer, tool-level authentication, and
  logging.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Integrate Azure AI Evaluation SDK into pipeline; build
  A/B testing harness.
- **Scale & Integrate**: Integrate MCP server into Copilot Studio/Teams AI
  pipeline; roll out across HeraldStack.
