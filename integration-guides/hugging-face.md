ðŸ§  Hugging Face Best Practices for HeraldStack
Version: v0.0.1
Scope: GenAI Inference, Training, Embeddings, Model Customization, and Agent-Aware Architecture
Source Alignment: Hugging Face Docs, Hub, Transformers, Inference Endpoints
Applies To: Offline + Online Agent Behavior, Pinecone Embeddings, Serverless Function Inference, and Local-Device Execution (Pixel 9 Pro, Intel MacBook)

ðŸ”§ Core Engineering Practices
âœ… Model Selection
Use Task-Specific Models: Choose pre-trained models optimized for specific agent roles (e.g., gpt2 for generative, distilbert-base-uncased for NER).

Leverage Model Cards: Review model cards for license, intended use, and limitations.

Example: For emotionally tuned responses â†’ mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.

âœ… Model Optimization
Quantization & Distillation: For local and mobile execution (e.g. Pixel 9 Pro), use onnx, bitsandbytes, or distilled models.

Avoid Large Inference Bottlenecks: Use AutoModelForSequenceClassification or AutoModelForTokenClassification in async Lambda pipelines.

Zero-Shot/ Few-Shot: Prefer zero-shot prompting (pipeline(task="zero-shot-classification", â€¦)) to reduce training costs.

ðŸ§° System Integration
âœ… Transformers + Pipelines
Use transformers.pipeline to abstract complexity:

ðŸ“¦ Deployment & Scaling
âœ… Hugging Face Inference Endpoints
For hosted + managed inference, use Inference Endpoints.

Ideal for low-latency APIs bound to EventBridge triggers in HeraldStack.

Use IAM-bound secret environment variables to prevent PII leaks.

Deploy within AWS us-east-1 or GCP us-central1 to reduce latency to Pinecone + Bedrock.

âœ… Serverless Model Inference
For AWS Lambda:

Use Hugging Face Docker images with transformers + torch preloaded.

Example image: huggingface/transformers-pytorch-gpu

Avoid cold-start penalties by setting concurrency >1 and using provisioned concurrency.

âœ… Offline/Edge Inference
Convert models to ONNX with optimum:

bash
Copy
Edit
optimum-cli export onnx --model distilbert-base-uncased output_model/
Store ONNX models in secure S3 â†’ CloudFront â†’ mobile cache.

ðŸ§  Embeddings & Memory (Pinecone-Ready)
âœ… Embedding Models
Use sentence-transformers for Pinecone vector inserts:
Convert models to ONNX with optimum:
Use Case	Model
Thought Logging	all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Emotion Memory	sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2
Agent Dialogue	intfloat/e5-base-v2 (retrieval-optimized)

âœ… Embedding Best Practices
Normalize embeddings before insert.

Store agent, tone, timestamp, context_scope in Pinecone metadata.
Use sentence-transformers for Pinecone vector inserts:
Bind access via IAM roles scoped to Lambda or Step Functions for multi-agent coordination.

âœ… Secure Local/Offline Agents
Store model artifacts on encrypted S3 (SSE-KMS) with signed URLs for local/edge downloads.

Use hardware-backed secure storage on Pixel 9 (Titan M2 chip) for model key materials.
