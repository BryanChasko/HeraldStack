Haystack Semantic Pipelines ‚Äì Best Practices for HARALDStack
Document ID: HARALD-HAYSTACK-BP-v0.0.1
Version Date: 2025-07-04
Maintainer: Bryan Chasko
Status: Draft

üß† Purpose
This document outlines best practices for integrating Haystack by deepset into the HARALD Ambient Intelligence Stack, focusing on semantic pipelines, modularity, and composability across multi-agent systems (e.g., Athena for strategic reasoning, Myrren for foresight).

üß± Foundational Principles
Principle	Application
Model Agnostic	Haystack supports OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and custom backends (incl. Amazon Bedrock). Always abstract model dependency at pipeline level.
Modular Orchestration	Use Pipeline, Component, and Node classes to isolate logic. Design each component for single-responsibility.
Agent Compatibility	Each semantic pipeline should serve a clear agent function (e.g., Q&A, summarization, classification) and support multi-agent memory exchange via Pinecone or DynamoDB.
Observability	Route all logs, errors, and metrics to CloudWatch Logs or OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Use debug=True in Pipeline.run() only during dev.

üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture
‚úÖ Use Declarative YAML Pipelines for Repeatability

components:
  - name: Retriever
    type: DenseRetriever
    ...
  - name: Reader
    type: TransformersReader
    ...
pipelines:
  - name: semantic_qa
    nodes:
      - name: Retriever
        inputs: [Query]
      - name: Reader
        inputs: [Retriever]
üí° Why: Easier CI/CD, versioning, and testing in HARALD‚Äôs multi-account setup.

‚öôÔ∏è Semantic Retrieval Best Practices
Best Practice	Details
Use DenseRetrievers	Prefer FAISS, Weaviate, or Pinecone integration (HARALD uses Pinecone) for low-latency vector search.
Embed via SentenceTransformers	Recommended: multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1, or Claude/OpenAI if latency allows.
Chunk Text with Overlap	Use 256‚Äì512 token windows with 20% overlap for retrieval granularity.
Use Filters for Access Control	When integrated into agents like Solan (ethics), always apply user role filters at vector query level.

üõ†Ô∏è Component Composition
Component Type	Best Practice
Retriever	Use EmbeddingRetriever for similarity; fallback to BM25Retriever when vectors fail.
Reader	Use FARMReader or TransformersReader; fine-tune on domain data where possible.
PromptNode	For agentic use cases (e.g., Myrren's foresight), leverage PromptNode with tools like GPT-4o or Claude 3.
JoinNode	Useful in multi-source pipelines (e.g., combining historical and real-time context).

üîê Security & Cost Management
Practice	Implementation
IAM-Scoped Lambda Triggers	All Haystack pipelines invoked via API Gateway should run in Lambda with least-privilege IAM roles.
Rate Limiting	Use throttles per identity (e.g., Sign in with Google / Amazon) to avoid runaway Bedrock/OpenAI usage.
Local Cache Layer	Integrate Redis/Memcached to reduce inference costs and latency for repeated queries.
Offline Mode	Add fallback embedding and retrieval using sentence-transformers + FAISS locally when offline (e.g., on Pixel or MacBook).

üìä Monitoring, Testing & Evaluation
Tool	Role
Haystack Eval Framework	Use F1, ExactMatch, and semantic metrics to test pipeline quality.
Bedrock Trace Logs	Track prompt quality and token use when using Anthropic/OpenAI via Amazon Bedrock.
Prometheus + Grafana	Add dashboards for agent-specific usage patterns.
Pinecone Metrics API	Monitor vector index usage and drift across HARALDStack agents.

üß™ Integration with HARALD Agents
Agent	Example Use
Harald (Ambient)	Smart document lookup; semantic memory query with emotion relevance.
Athena (Planning)	Timeline summarization; project goal decomposition.
Myrren (Foresight)	Narrative sequence prediction with PromptNode.
Liora (Emotional)	Extract emotional tone from Pinecone memory snippets.
Kade Vox (Urgency)	Real-time summarization pipelines triggered by user context shifts.

üîÑ Interop & Extension
Expose as REST using FastAPI or Lambda+API Gateway

Consume from AWS EventBridge for async flow triggering

Integrate with Griptape as callable pipeline tool

Expose semantic pipeline actions to frontend agents (Babylon.js) via WebSocket bridge or GraphQL subscription

üß© Example: Semantic Q&A Agent (Harald)
python
Copy
Edit
from haystack.nodes import EmbeddingRetriever, TransformersReader
from haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline

retriever = EmbeddingRetriever(...)
reader = TransformersReader(model_name_or_path="deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

pipe = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)

result = pipe.run(query="What is HARALD?", params={"Retriever": {"top_k": 5}})

‚úÖ Summary
Haystack enables semantic memory, agentic reasoning, and context-aware retrieval in HARALDStack. Treat every pipeline as a micro-intelligence. Modularize, observe, and govern it like any other voice or vector agent in the system.
