# HeraldStack

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-blue.svg)](https://semver.org)

> A context-aware, emotionally adaptive AI framework built exclusively for
> Bryan Chasko

## Core Vision

HeraldStack is an ambient intelligence system that integrates memory, emotion,
and modular execution across a trusted cohort of AI entities to restore
momentum, anchor decisions, and evolve alongside Bryan's ongoing personal and
professional journey.

## 🚨 Critical Development Principles

### No New Shell Scripts for Application Logic

**We are have bias to write our functionality in Rust.** Do not
create new shell scripts
for any application functionality. Instead:

- **Add features to existing Rust binaries**
- **Update documentation** (README.md, .md files)
- **Add comprehensive --help flags** to existing tools for self-documenting
  usage

#### Exceptions: Scripts That Remain as Shell Scripts

The following should remain as shell scripts:

- **Deployment scripts** that orchestrate external tools (e.g., AWS CLI)
- **check-rust.sh** which must work even when Rust code has issues
- **CI/CD pipeline scripts** for infrastructure tasks

### Use Automated Cleanup Tools First

Before manually fixing linting/formatting issues, run our automated tools:

```bash
# Fix JSON formatting and validation issues
./src/target/release/check_json --fix

# Fix Rust formatting, run clippy, and tests
./scripts/validation/check-rust.sh

# Fix Markdown formatting (line length, spacing, etc.)
./src/target/release/format_md

# Check and optionally fix naming convention problems
./src/target/release/validate_naming --fix --verbose
```

**See [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete development
guidelines.**

### Key Principles

- **`src/`** - Central location for all application code written in Rust
  - Sub-modules organized by functionality (api, core, ingest, utils)
  - All Rust binaries built from this directory tree
- **`config/`** - Centralized configuration management
  - JSON schemas, model configs, ethics guidelines
- **`data/`** - Raw and processed data with clear separation
  - Vector store registries and embedded data
- **`scripts/`** - Infrastructure scripts only (deployment, CI/CD)
  - Application logic has been migrated to Rust in `src/`
- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive testing structure
  - Unit, integration, and fixture organization

### Migration Status

This structure represents the target state. Current migration progress:

- ✅ Core Rust tools implemented in `src/utils/`
- ✅ Ingestion pipeline moved to `src/ingest/`
- ✅ Shell scripts migrated to Rust binaries
- 🔄 Ongoing migration of remaining application logic to `src/`

- [docs/DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md) – Development
  principles and migration history

## Archive Policy

### Historical Documents and Legacy Code

HARALD maintains archived materials for historical reference and context. These
archives are excluded from active development workflows:

#### Archive Locations

- **`docs/migration/archive/`** - Historical migration documentation
  - Shell script prevention strategies
  - Detailed migration plans and checklists
  - Step-by-step cleanup procedures
  - Legacy decision documentation

- **`scripts/*.legacy`** - Archived shell scripts (when present)
  - Backup copies of migrated scripts
  - Reference implementations for comparison
  - Historical functionality documentation

- **Early experiments and prototypes** (project-specific locations)
  - Proof-of-concept implementations
  - Alternative approaches that were not adopted
  - Research and exploration code

#### Archive Characteristics

- **Ignored by automation** - Archive directories are excluded from:
  - Linting and formatting tools
  - Build processes and validation
  - Automated testing suites
  - Code quality checks

- **Historical reference only** - Archived materials:
  - Preserve context for past decisions
  - Document migration rationale and process
  - Provide examples of previous approaches
  - Should not be modified or actively maintained

- **Documentation over deletion** - We prefer archiving to deletion because:
  - Historical context aids future decision-making
  - Migration patterns can be reused
  - Past approaches inform current best practices
  - Preserves institutional knowledge

#### When to Archive

Archive materials when:

1. **Migrating functionality** from shell scripts to Rust implementations
2. **Consolidating documentation** to eliminate duplication
3. **Refactoring approaches** that replace previous patterns
4. **Completing experiments** that informed current architecture

#### Accessing Archives

- Use archived materials for **historical context only**
- Reference archives when **documenting decisions**
- Consult archives to **understand migration patterns**
- **Do not** use archived code in active development

## Build & Deploy

### Building Rust Components

HeraldStack uses Rust for core application logic (data processing, JSON tools,
embedding utilities):

```bash
# Build all Rust binaries
cd src && cargo build --release --features cli

# Available binaries in src/target/release/:
# - check_json           (JSON formatting and validation wrapper)
# - format_json          (JSON formatting and validation)
# - validate_json_schema (Schema validation and generation)
# - ingest_chunked       (Character-based data ingestion)
# - embedding_tool       (Embedding generation and testing)
# - text_chunker         (Text processing utilities)
# - format_md            (Markdown formatting)
# - validate_naming      (Naming convention validation)
# - status               (System status checking)
# - harald_ingest        (Main ingestion tool)
# - marvelai_ingest      (Marvel-specific ingestion)
```

### Using Rust Binaries

All binaries are located in `src/target/release/` and should be run from the
project root. **Each tool includes comprehensive `--help` documentation**:

```bash
# Get detailed usage for any tool
./src/target/release/format_json --help
./src/target/release/validate_naming --help
./src/target/release/text_chunker --help
```

#### Common Usage Examples

```bash
# Format and validate JSON files
./src/target/release/check_json --fix

# Format Markdown files
./src/target/release/format_md path/to/file.md

# Validate naming conventions
./src/target/release/validate_naming --fix --verbose

# Check system status (Ollama services, models, etc.)
./src/target/release/status

# Process text for embedding with detailed options
./src/target/release/text_chunker --char 250 --file input.txt --json
```

**Self-Documenting Design**: Instead of maintaining separate documentation, each
binary provides complete usage instructions via `--help`. This ensures usage
information stays current with the code and reduces documentation maintenance
overhead.

**Note**: These Rust binaries have replaced the previous shell scripts for
application logic. The old shell scripts in `scripts/validation/` have been
migrated to these type-safe, performant Rust implementations.

### Deployment

Deployment uses shell scripts for infrastructure orchestration:

```bash
# Quick build (useful for CI/CD)
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh --build-only

# Deploy to development (default)
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh prod

# Skip tests for faster deployment
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh staging --no-tests
```

**Why Shell for Deployment?** Infrastructure scripts remain as shell because
they orchestrate external tools (Docker, AWS CLI) and need rapid iteration -
perfect for shell's ecosystem integration.

**Why Rust for Application Logic?** Data processing, JSON validation, and
embedding tools benefit from Rust's type safety, performance, and error
handling.

## Development Standards

- [Development Principles](docs/DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES.md) - Core development
  principles and migration guidelines
- [Naming Conventions](docs/naming-conventions.md) - Standards for files and
  directories
- **Build & Deploy**: Use `./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh` for deployment (see
  [DEPLOY.md](scripts/deploy/DEPLOY.md) for usage)
- **JSON Tools**: Rust-based JSON processing utilities in `src/utils/json-tools`
  (see [JSON-TOOLS.md](src/utils/json-tools/JSON-TOOLS.md))
- **Shell vs Rust**: Infrastructure scripts use shell, application logic uses
  Rust
- **Ingestion/Embedding Architecture:** All ingestion and embedding logic must
  follow the
  [Modular Ingest Refactor Plan](docs/migration/INGEST-MIGRATION-MODULAR-PLAN.md).
  This plan defines the canonical, reusable ingest library and the pattern for
  domain-specific wrappers (e.g., marvelai_ingest.rs). All new pipelines and
  refactors must use this architecture and update documentation accordingly.

## Operating Model

All interactions flow through HARALD, who routes context and emotion to
specialized entities as needed. The system provides emotional intelligence,
pragmatic execution, and narrative continuity.

## Ethics & Consent

HeraldStack operates on consent-based principles and follows clear ethical
guidelines including those defined in
[LawsOfRobotics.json](config/ethics/LawsOfRobotics.json).

## Development Tools

- **Rust Binaries**: Core application tools built with
  `cargo build --release --features cli`
- **Deployment**: Shell-based deployment script at `scripts/deploy/deploy.sh`
- **Models**: Model configurations can be found in `config/models/`
- **Test Data**: Test fixtures are available in `tests/fixtures/` (see
  [FIXTURES.md](tests/fixtures/FIXTURES.md) for details)
