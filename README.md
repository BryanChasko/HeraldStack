# HeraldStack

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-blue.svg)](https://semver.org)

> A context-aware, emotionally adaptive AI framework built exclusively for Bryan
> Chasko

## Core Vision

HeraldStack is an ambient intelligence system that integrates memory, emotion,
and modular execution across a trusted cohort of AI entities to restore
momentum, anchor decisions, and evolve alongside Bryan's ongoing personal and
professional journey.

## Key Components

- **ü¶ä HARALD** ‚Äì Default entity for emotional mirroring, decision anchoring,  
  and continuity management
- **üß† Herald Entity Cohort** ‚Äì Specialized assistants with distinct
  personalities and roles
- **üåê Cloud Capable Infrastructure** ‚Äì Modular architecture using AWS
- **üìö Narrative-Aware UX** ‚Äì Long-memory interactions rooted in Bryan's story
  arcs
- **üîç Vector Search** ‚Äì Optimized embedding process with character-based
  chunking
  - [Vector Store Registry](docs/vector-search/vector-store-registry.md) for
    managing JSON data
  - [Character-Based Chunking](docs/vector-search/character-based-chunking.md)
    for optimal text processing
  - [Ollama API Limitations](docs/vector-search/ollama-embedding-limits.md) and
    workarounds

## Core Capabilities

- Persistent awareness of Bryan's preferences, goals, and activities
- Collaboration modes: Co-Pilot, Auto, and Recall
- Consent-based logging for conversations and insights
- Calendar intelligence for optimal scheduling
- JSONL-optimized vector ingestion for efficient embedding processing
- Thought organization with automatic categorization
- Weekly review for continuous system improvement

## Technical Stack

| Component       | Technology      |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Compute         | AWS Lambda      |
| Storage         | Amazon S3       |
| State Tracking  | Amazon DynamoDB |
| Semantic Memory | Pinecone        |

## Development Standards

- [Naming Conventions](docs/naming-conventions.md) - Standards for files and
  directories
- Automated validation scripts in `scripts/validation`
  (see [VALIDATION.md](scripts/validation/VALIDATION.md))
- JSON tooling and vector store registry in `scripts/json-tools`
  (see [JSON-TOOLS.md](scripts/json-tools/JSON-TOOLS.md))
- [Project Structure](docs/migration/RECOMMENDED-STRUCTURE.md) - Recommended organization

## Operating Model

All interactions flow through HARALD, who routes context and emotion to
specialized entities as needed. The system provides emotional intelligence,
pragmatic execution, and narrative continuity.
